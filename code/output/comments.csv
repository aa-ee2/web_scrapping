ecm1zg,fbcbunc,"I posted this as I watched it live in the Live Thread. In case anyone wasn‚Äôt able to watch the live debates this evening, Adam Schiff delivered the quote of this century which deserves its place in history. 


Adam Schiff waited patiently as John Ratcliffe delivered fire and brimstone against the Democrats, the Unfair Process, the Unnamed Whistleblower, and then cooly laid a fucking poetic sledgehammer and leveled every Republican response, in one line:

Rep John Ratcliffe, (R) Texas:   ‚ÄúHistory will remember this day as the day the Democrats impeached the president for nothing more than spite.‚Äù

Adam Schiff, (D) California;   **‚ÄùMadam Speaker, I think when the history of this time is written, it will record that when my colleagues found they lacked the courage to stand up to this unethical president, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.‚Äù**

Schiff is a uniquely gifted orator. These 39 words will be immortalized in history as one sentence which so brilliantly and concisely summarized the willing, blindful, repugnant actions of the GOP, offset by the Democrats trying to ballast our democracy by impeaching this dangerous and corrupt president.

Having the president publicly criticizing corporations and individuals for their dealings with members of his family or his private businesses is a serious ethical issue that can have real-world ramifications for anyone the president targets with his ire. The fact that he hasn't divested his private business interests is also an ethical issue that compounds the first issue.

In this case, I'm not sure that Donald Trump understands ethics in government as a concept, much less business ethics. That explains why we continue to see this behavior.

Will he suffer any tangible consequences for it? I doubt it. He hasn't suffered any so far, and this has been an issue for months even before the inauguration. The Republican-controlled Congress doesn't seem to care about what Trump does, as long as he continues to help them push their agenda forward and maintains the (R) next to his name.

This is all to say nothing of the cognitive dissonance required for Donald Trump to criticize Nordstrom for not doing business with his daughter, when just a few months ago he was talking about how using tax loopholes to minimize his businesses owed taxes **isn't** unfair it just ""makes (him) smart"".

In the same breath, I don't know which republicans I have faith in to actually buck Trump. Maybe Graham is finally moving in that direction?

This type of scenario needs nuanced communications and deep legal understanding, neither of which are this administration's strong suit. If Trump defends Flynn, who apparently is strongly liked by the President and Bannon, it will be the creation of a huge political scandal.

Questions remaining: Why was Conway so sure of Trump's total confidence in Flynn? Was she out of the loop? Was she lying? Something to keep track of.

Wasn't Flynn one of the possible choices for VP? I think this new info puts that in a new light. 

Trump's approval ratings will sink lower. I think we could see calls for investigations into Flynn or even wider investigations from Republicans nervous about reelection. 

Most importantly: What did Trump know, and when? Was Trump aware of Flynn's call before the call was made? 

Note how it's always been a major point that Pence was not aware and was lied to. That could be a very important point soon. 


EDIT Tuesday AM: Kellyanne Conway is on the news this morning making it sound like the reason Flynn had to go was that he lied to Pence. This makes no sense because they've known for at least two weeks that he lied to Pence. 

Yates was fired immediately for insubordination, but Flynn stayed on for two weeks with the full confidence of the president? And it was Flynn's decision alone to resign? 

This all makes it sound very much like Flynn was not acting alone. Pence's role in all of this makes perfect sense if you look at it from the perspective that he's setting himself up to come out of this unscathed if it takes down Trump. 

EDIT Tuesday late AM: Republican Senator Roy Blunt is calling for an investigation into Trump's ties with Russia. Chaffetz says he's not investigating. Chaffetz should be investigated

EDIT Tuesday PM: Where's Reince Priebus?

EDIT Tuesday late PM: Spicer says Flynn was asked to resign. Yet another detail where Conway was out of the loop, or lying. Why does anyone have Conway on their show?

Trump was briefed about Flynn on Jan 26, almost three weeks ago. And now they've come up with the ""erosion of trust"" line. Smells like BS to me. The political situation became untenable, so he had to go. 

We need to know what Mike Pence knew, and when. Sounds like a good chance that Mike Pence lied to the country about Flynn's call. 

Steve Bannon is looking mighty lonely on the National Security Council.

As soon as Trump gets any evidence of Graham or McCain communicating with The Ukrainian Government he will probably have them arrested for violating The Hatch Act. 

We're heading into dark times, America. ",1818

No explanation was given.

Edit: since this post is now at the top I'd like to expand on the ongoing situation.

I ask you where do you see this stopping? 

Remember, Donald Trump promised to have a deportation force to remove over 10 million undocumented immigrants, promised to punish women who get abortions, promised to bomb the innocent families of terrorists (Geneva Convention violation), recently threatened to ""send the Feds"" to Chicago if violence does not stop, his VP is openly and strongly anti-LGBTQ, he placed his white supremacist toady Bannon to a permanent position in the NSC and revoked the CJCS and DNI permanent seats. This is just a small sample.

What happens when American citizens, that may physically look like undocumented immigrants, get caught in a deportation raid? What happens when the American military murders innocent civilians? What happens when the Feds he threatened to send to Chicago kill innocent American citizens?

Where's the line here?",794

eclwg9,fbcdtx6,"Okay for everyone wondering what impeachment is vs a removal of office.

Impeachment is like charging you with a crime. So the House of Representatives charged Trump with abuse of power & obstruction of congress.

Removal of office comes about when the House of Representatives vote by a majority to impeach on each charge (known as an Article of Impeachment), that goes to the Senate, and then by a 2/3 majority (67 Senators) in the Senate to vote to convict, and only then is the President is finally removed from office.

In other words, impeachment is like being charged by the DA for manslaughter, removal of office is when the jury decides you're guilty of manslaughter. The DA is the House, and the jury is the Senate in this analogy.

Trump has known since 14 days before his Inauguration that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the attacks on our elections. He has obfuscated and denied and covered for Putin for 558 days.

And Trump still has yet to directly state that Putin ordered the attack. The closest he has come is saying that Putin would be responsible as leader of his country (as covered in the article).

This is watershed. Trump is failing to serve America's best interest, and this behavior alone should rise to being an impeachable defense. No previous President in history would have survived aiding a foreign power in this way.

Over 100 news agencies sitting in 100 contries all over the world are disclosing the panama papers tonight at the exact same time. This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked. I am curious to see who turns up as well. What a leak!! All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. As op linked to

Before reading further: 
Here is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:

>Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can ""spend"" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.

*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons! (thanks /u/Toppo) [orig. comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4d75i7/26_terabyte_leak_of_panamanian_shell_company_data/d1og7kz)*

Edit: 'Die Zeit' another big German newspaper writes that about 200k  letterbox companies (in total 11.5 million records) are disclosed... Jesus what is going on. This will be big news for the next few weeks (hopefully longer than that!)

Edit2: the icij had released a YouTube video [here:](https://youtu.be/F6XnH_OnpO0) which sums up what is in those documents. (Even if someone is speaking in the video very calm there is really disturbing stuff in there like people trafficking and sex slavery etc...)

    Mohammed VI of Morocco might also be involved. Mossack Fonseca created the company to which his personal yatch is registered.


    Family members of Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbajan also used Fonseca to manage mining and real estate investments.

t20u4i,hyj4lio,"While it is used to process transactions, it does not move or hold money and securities. SWIFT uses standardized codes for instructions that enable banks to process payments quickly.

It was founded in 1973. In 2021, the service was used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries. It processes around 10 billion financial messages a year.

Who owns SWIFT?

SWIFT is owned by member banks. It is governed by a 25-member board of directors. According to its website, it is overseen by the G10 central banks ‚Äî Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Great Britain, the United States, Switzerland and Sweden ‚Äî as well as the European Central Bank.

How is it used?

The format is used by financial institutions to facilitate cross-border payments.

For instance, if a company in France is buying a product from Russia, the French company can transfer money from its French bank account to the Russian company‚Äôs bank account by using the Russian company‚Äôs account number and its SWIFT code.

The French company will then send a message via SWIFT to the Russian company that the transfer of the money is incoming, and that it can access the funds.

What happens if Russia is removed from SWIFT?

If Russia is removed from SWIFT, the country‚Äôs ability to do business with other countries would be impacted. Shipments of metals, oil, gas and other commodities could stop for at least some period of time.

‚ÄúIf Russia is disconnected from SWIFT, then we will not receive [foreign] currency, but buyers, European countries in the first place, will not receive our goods,‚Äù Nikolai Zhuravlev, vice speaker of Russia‚Äôs upper house of parliament, said last month.

According to the Financial Times, the European Central Bank has warned lenders that Russia may be suspended from SWIFT.

If Russia is suspended from SWIFT, the country would see a significant economic disruption for a period of time, Elina Ribakova, an economist at the Washington-based Institute for International Finance, told Radio Free Europe.

The disruption could cause the Russian economy to contract and send the country‚Äôs currency, the ruble, tumbling in the short term, Ribakova said.

A major disruption would likely be temporary, though, as Russia would have some tools to combat a suspension.

What can Russia do about it?

Russia does have its own payment system, the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), but it is a much smaller operation than SWIFT.

SPFS has around 400 users and is responsible for about 20% of domestic transfers, so being cut off from SWIFT would cause major financial problems for the country.
